# Description
Unity project containing a simple Hi-Lo card game.  This game is largely just a practice to jump-start more complex games.

# Build
Currently targeted towards WebGL.

# Gameplay
As of v1.0, gameplay goes as follows:
- Player hits the New Game button to start a game
- Player hits the Draw button to place a card in the left hand slot
- Player guesses whether the next card will be Hi(gher) or Lo(wer) than the left card
- The next card is flipped.  If the player was right, their score goes up by 1.  If wrong, it goes down by 1.  If the cards are equal, no points are scored.
- When the deck is exhausted, the game ends and the option to start a new game is presented.
